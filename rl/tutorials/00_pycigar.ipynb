    "PyCIGAR is a connection between grid simulators (OpenDSS, GridLab-D,...) and the scalable RL library RLlib. PyCIGAR formalises grid control problem as a RL problem and provides formalised environments to conduct a variety of RL experiments without concern about the difference between grid simulators and scaling up RL experiments.    \n",
